# Inspire OS ISO
The files packaged in the InspireOS ISO image (burnt to USB/DVD for use)
These are NOT to be copied to USB. The ISO image, which can be downloaded from Mega at https://mega.nz/#!drRkUYbA!gYHZsxjb5G92ZexQlWVGUfUAq18SChKuoyqULCmzF-A, is to be burnt to your USB via a third-party tool such as Rufus.

Known issues:
- If the username of the installed user is not "cs" which is the advised default, the bluetooth manager will repeatedly request for you to configure a default directory for it to push received files into. To configure this, run blueman-services in the terminal and select a folder location.
